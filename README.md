Earthquake prediction remains a challenging scientific endeavor. Currently, scientists primarily focus on earthquake forecasting and early warning systems rather than precise prediction. Forecasting involves assessing the probability of earthquakes occurring in a specific region over a certain time frame based on historical data and geological studies. Early warning systems use seismic sensors to detect initial seismic waves and provide seconds to minutes of warning before stronger shaking arrives, giving people and infrastructure a brief opportunity to prepare.

The ability to predict earthquakes with exact timing and location in advance remains elusive due to the complex and dynamic nature of Earth's tectonic processes. Scientists continue to research and develop methods to improve our understanding of seismic activity and enhance early warning capabilities, but accurate prediction remains a long-term goal.
